# Grok Chatbot

This project is a sophisticated chatbot application that leverages the Grok API to provide interactive chat capabilities. The application is built using React for the client-side and Express for the server-side, allowing users to communicate with an AI assistant in real-time. The chatbot is designed to handle user inputs and respond with AI-generated messages, which are rendered in markdown format for enhanced readability.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can type messages and receive responses from the AI.
- **Markdown Support**: The chat messages support markdown formatting, allowing for rich text responses.
- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Users can input knowledge data, which is processed and stored for enhancing AI responses.
- **Server/Client Model**: The application is structured with a clear separation between the server and client, facilitating efficient data handling and processing.

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client**: Built with React, it provides the user interface for interacting with the chatbot and managing the knowledge base. The client communicates with the server via RESTful APIs to send user inputs and receive AI-generated responses.
- **Server**: Built with Express, it handles API requests from the client, processes chat completions, and manages the knowledge base. The server uses the Grok API to generate AI responses and store knowledge data.

## APIs and Models

- **Grok API**: Utilized for generating AI responses to user inputs. The API processes the text and returns a coherent and contextually relevant message.
- **OpenAI API**: Used to generate embeddings for the knowledge base data. These embeddings help in understanding and retrieving relevant information efficiently.
- **Pinecone**: A vector database service used to store and manage embeddings generated by the OpenAI API. This allows for fast and scalable similarity searches within the knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base API**: Allows users to input and store knowledge data, which is used to enhance the AI's response capabilities. This API ensures that the AI can access and utilize stored information effectively.

## Setup Process

To get started with the Grok Chatbot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and fill in your configuration details, including the server port and API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone.
4. **Configure the Server**: Ensure the server configuration in `config.js` is set up correctly, including the client origin and server port.
5. **Start the Server**: Run `npm run server` to start the Express server.
6. **Start the Client**: In a separate terminal, navigate to the client directory and run `npm start` to launch the React application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the chatbot.

## Usage

- **Chat Completions**: Type a message in the chat input and press Enter to send. The AI will respond with a generated message using the Grok API.
- **Knowledge Base**: Switch to the knowledge base screen to input new knowledge data. This data is processed to generate embeddings using the OpenAI API and stored in Pinecone for efficient retrieval and enhanced AI responses.

Enjoy chatting with your AI assistant and building a comprehensive knowledge base!
